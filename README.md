# Augustan Calendar

The Augustan Calendar is an experimental HTML application that reimagines how time is organized. It divides the year into ten months of four ten‑day weeks and represents each day using base‑10 time, offering a unique way to view dates alongside the familiar Gregorian system.

## Features

- **Day themes** (Spirit, Soul, Mind, Body) highlight key days of every ten‑day cycle
- **Special days** in the last month (Christmas Eve, Christmas, Leap Day, etc.)
- **Dual time display** showing both Gregorian and Augustan dates and times
- **Keyboard navigation** with arrow keys and a button to jump to today
- **Responsive UI** built with Tailwind CSS for desktop and mobile
- **Multiple month naming systems**: numerical, disciple-based, and seasonal
- **Hoverable legend** to spotlight all days of a given theme

## Getting Started

1. Open `Augustan Calendar.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Use the dropdowns or arrow keys to browse months and see how each ten‑day week is arranged.
3. Watch the time panel to compare standard and base‑10 clocks in real time.

## Use Cases

- Explore alternative calendars or timekeeping systems
- Teach about base‑10 time and non‑Gregorian dates
- Provide inspiration for science fiction or world‑building projects

## Technical Details

- Pure HTML, Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript
- Calculates Augustan dates from the current Gregorian date
- Updates the display every second without page reloads
- Adjusts layout based on screen width for mobile devices
